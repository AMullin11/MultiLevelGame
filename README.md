# MultiLevelGame

#Known Bugs as of submitting

1) Movement controls are awful, needs to be improved
2) In the built game, Level 1 allows you to return to the title screen by not deactivating the prev button like it should and does in-editor.
3) Visually, the game is somewhat unappealing


#Controls

WASD/Arrow keys: Movement
Mouse Movement: Move the camera around the level
